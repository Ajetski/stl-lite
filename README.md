# stl-lite

This repository implements selected parts of C++ STL. A key purposes of this repo is 
to demonstrate to students how to:
- interpret the C++ standard and other technical documents;
- implement STL parts "reasonably well";
- develop unit tests; and
- use a version-control system to engineer non-trivial software in a team environment.

Students also have opportunity to contribute to the implementation.

**Caveat:** Due to schedule and other constraints, the material in this repo is not always
correct, complete, or compliant. For the most part, the master branch tends to be the most
"reliable", but there are no guarantees.
